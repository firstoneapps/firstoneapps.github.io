description: App for <a href="https://impossiblehq.com/cold-shower-therapy-guide/" target="_blank">Cold Shower Therapy challenge</a>. We took over development of version 2.0, squashed existing bugs and added new features such as Facebook login, in-app purchases, cold shower details. We moved backend to Parse and then moved it to Parse Server on Heroku with help of <a href=http://bluelinelabs.com target="_blank">BlueLine Labs</a>.
